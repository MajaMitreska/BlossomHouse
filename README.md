This is a school project where a website was built for an online e-shop. This online store is a flower shop that sells flowers, plants ang gift online.
The website has few pages: Home page, About us, Contact Us, Flowers, Plants, Gifts, Shopping Cart, Search Bar and Sign in/out options.

There are two different roles: user and admin. A user with a role of a customer can browse the products, choose some of them, like them, add them in their shopping cart and proceed with the checkout process.
After the checkout the user have to fill a form with billing info and information about the delivery. This process ends with the payment form, where card number and similar information are needed to have successful transaction.
**The payment form is just a simple form; the actual transaction process is not implemented! **

The admin role has more responsibilities, they can add new products and edit/delete existing ones.

Moreover, if you are not registered user, you can register directly through a form on the website or register/sing in through Google.
Additionally, an e-mail is sent whether the order was successful.
